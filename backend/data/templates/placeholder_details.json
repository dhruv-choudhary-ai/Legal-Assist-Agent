The said family has a family Deity of Goddess............... and the family has installed the same in one of the rooms of the said house.\n7.     The Settlers have therefore proposed to dedicate the said house and premises to the said Deity and to continue to worship the same and with these objects they have decided to create a private Trust of the said property.\n8.     The Settlers have also collected a Fund of Rs............... as the initial fund or Corpus to meet the expenses of maintaining the said house and to worship the said idol.\n9.     It is proposed that...........,...........,..........., will act as the first Trustees of the Trust and the settlers have proposed to transfer the said property to...........,........... &........... as Trustees to hold the property for the benefit of the said family in the manner aforesaid.\nNOW  this Deed Witnesseth that pursuant to the said desire of the settlers and in the premises aforesaid the settlers do and each of them doth hereby grant and transfer the said house with the land appurtenant thereto situate at........... and more particularly described in the Schedule hereunder written and all the rights liberties, privileges and easements appurtenant to the said house and the land and all the estate right, title and interest of the settlers in or to the said property hereby granted unto the Trustees and also transfer the Fund of Rs............
